# Environment File

1. Create the .env File:
   Create a file named .env in the project root and provide your AWS S3 credentials

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=value
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=value
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=value
```

# Audio Files

1. Create the "audios" Folder:
   Ensure the existence of a folder named "audios" at the root of your project.

2. Organize by Day:
   Inside the "audios" folder, categorize your files into separate folders for each day. This structure simplifies the identification and management of audio files.

## Example Structure:

```
- YourProject
  - audios
    - 2024-01-03
      - audio1.mp3
      - audio2.mp3
    - 2024-01-04
      - audio3.mp3
      - audio4.mp3
```

Following these steps ensures an efficient organization of audio files in your project.
